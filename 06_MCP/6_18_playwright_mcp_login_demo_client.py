# Needs Node.js/npm (npx) - same official Playwright MCP server as
# 6_17_playwright_mcp_gold_price_client.py. Runs headed by default so you
# can watch the browser fill the form and log in - pass "--headless" as
# an extra npx arg below if you'd rather run it invisibly.
#
# practice.expandtesting.com/login is a well-known QA/automation practice
# site (the successor to the same author's the-internet.herokuapp.com)
# with published test credentials right on the page - no real account,
# no scraping-etiquette concerns, safe to hit repeatedly. This demonstrates
# browser_fill_form + browser_click, then checks the resulting page for
# the site's own success/failure banner text - once deliberately wrong,
# once with the correct password, to show both real outcomes.
#
# Order matters here: a correct login sets a session cookie, and visiting
# /login again while already authenticated just redirects straight to
# /secure - so the WRONG attempt runs first, while still unauthenticated.
