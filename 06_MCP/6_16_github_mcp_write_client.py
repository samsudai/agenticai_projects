# Write-side demo of GitHub's OFFICIAL MCP server. Unlike 6_9_2 (which
# pushes to the user's own real project) or 6_15 (which only reads
# octocat/Hello-World), this one actually creates content - a file and an
# issue - so it targets a THROWAWAY public repo under a THROWAWAY GitHub
# account made just for this demo, never the account/repo you use for real
# work. Owner/repo/token all come from .env (GITHUB_DEMO_OWNER,
# GITHUB_DEMO_REPO, GITHUB_WRITE_TOKEN) - nothing is hardcoded here, so
# this script itself carries no trace of any specific account.
#
# The content pushed is a small inline string, not a real file read off
# disk (6_9_2 did that, which is how a real project path ended up
# hardcoded) - keeps the demo fully self-contained.
